# FB_tagged_photos_downloader

### What

I want to close my FB account and save all the photos I'm tagged. Not only mines
### Problem

FB, in export data, don't save these images. Only the one that you own.

### How to do it

Download photos and videos you're tagged in on Facebook
Code developed starting from [this thread](https://gist.github.com/david-crespo/89baec40d680a17ebc2a4d622c5fc0cf)


### Setup On Linux

This requires Python 3.

1. Make sure you have `curl` (Linux and Mac likely already have it)
2. `mkdir photos videos` in the same directory as the script
3. `pip3 install selenium`
4. Download the [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/) executable and put it somewhere in your PATH
5. Set `FB_USER_ID` and `CHROME_PROFILE_PATH` in `helpers.py`
6. Set `CONTAINER_SELECTOR` (see below)

### `CONTAINER_SELECTOR`

The photo downloader relies on a particular class that is likely to change over time because it's auto-generated by FB's frontend build process. It was `.atb` when I wrote this but it'll probably change all the time. You'll have to dig into the source of the photo page to figure out what the right class is.

### Running it

`python3 tagged_photos.py` or `python3 tagged_videos.py`

### Improve TODO

Parallelize download. Not know maybe using Celery+Radis.
